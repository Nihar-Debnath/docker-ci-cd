In **Next.js**, the `dev` and `start` scripts serve **very different purposes** — and using the right one in the right environment is crucial, especially for performance and stability.

---

### 🚀 `dev` Script — For Development Only
```json
"dev": "next dev"
```
- Starts the app in **development mode**.
- Enables **hot reloading**, **detailed error messages**, **source maps**, etc.
- Not optimized — everything is compiled on the fly.
- Great for local development, **but slow and resource-heavy** for production.

---

### ✅ `start` Script — For Production Only
```json
"build": "next build",
"start": "next start"
```
- You **first run** `next build` to compile and optimize your app.
- Then `next start` runs the **pre-built and fully optimized version**.
- No hot reloading, just fast, static, or server-rendered pages as intended in production.
- It's **faster**, **more stable**, and **uses fewer resources**.

### 🔥 So Why Not Use `dev` in Production?
Using `next dev` in production is like:
> Driving a car with the hood open and tools all over the engine — meant for debugging, not cruising.

Problems if you use `dev` in production:
- Slower performance for users
- Unnecessary CPU usage
- Possible memory leaks
- Exposes detailed errors/logs which could be a **security risk**
