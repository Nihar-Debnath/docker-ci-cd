Let's break down the process and structure step by step so that the reasoning behind each part and the connections between the commands and setup become clearer.

### 1. **Creating a Docker Network:**
```sh
docker network create testing
```
- **Purpose:** This command creates a custom Docker network called `testing`. Docker networks are used to allow different Docker containers to communicate with each other, ensuring that containers inside the same network can reach each other via container names (like `postgres`) rather than using `localhost` or IP addresses.

- **Why this is important:** Normally, Docker containers are isolated from each other, but when you create a custom network, containers within that network can resolve each other's container names as hostnames. Without this, the containers wouldn't be able to connect using names like `postgres` since they would think `localhost` refers to their own container.

### 2. **Running PostgreSQL Container:**
```sh
docker run -d -p 5432:5432 --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=me --network testing postgres
```
- **Purpose:** This command runs a PostgreSQL container in detached mode (`-d`), exposing port 5432 so that the PostgreSQL database is accessible. The `--network testing` option attaches this container to the `testing` network (the one you just created).
  
- **Why this is important:** The `postgres` container is being run on a specific network, allowing it to communicate with any other container that’s also connected to the `testing` network. By running it in this way, you ensure that your web and other containers can access the database.

### 3. **Running Prisma Migrations (with `bunx`):**
```sh
cd .\packages\db\
bunx prisma migrate dev
cd ../../
```
- **Purpose:** In this step, you're changing the directory to `.\packages\db\` and running Prisma's `migrate dev` command to apply database migrations.
  
- **Why this is important:** Prisma migrations are typically used to apply schema changes to the database. The `migrate dev` command will apply any changes to your database schema, based on the Prisma schema definition file (`schema.prisma`). Running this command is crucial to ensure your database structure is up to date with your application.

- **Why `bunx` and not just `bun`?** It looks like you're using Bun as your runtime (based on previous Dockerfile instructions), and `bunx` is used to invoke executables installed via Bun (similar to `npx` in Node.js).

### 4. **Building the Next.js Application:**
```sh
cd .\apps\web\
bun run build # I am building my Next.js app first, then copying the .next folder into the Docker container, you can see it from Dockerfile.web
cd ../../
```
- **Purpose:** This step involves building your Next.js application using `bun run build`. The `bun run build` command is a part of the Bun runtime, and it builds the production version of your Next.js app, which usually compiles everything into the `.next` folder (this is where Next.js stores its build artifacts, including static files and pre-rendered pages).

- **Why this is important:** Since you are creating a Docker container for your web application, you need the built `.next` folder (the production build of your app) to be available inside the Docker container when it starts up. By building the app first, you’re ready to copy the `.next` folder into the Docker container during the build process.

- **Note:** You would probably be copying the `.next` folder into your Docker container using your `Dockerfile.web` during the `COPY` command, so when you run the container, your app is already in production-ready form.

### 5. **Docker Compose:**
```sh
docker-compose up --build
```
- **Purpose:** This command runs Docker Compose, which will:
  - Build the Docker images for the services defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file (because of the `--build` flag).
  - Start up the containers for the services in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
  
- **Why this is important:** Now that your `postgres` container is running, and your web application (Next.js app) has been built, Docker Compose will take care of running your entire application stack (which includes the backend, frontend, and database). This will allow all your services to communicate over the custom `testing` network.

---

### **Understanding Why This Structure Works:**

- **Network Configuration:** 
  By creating the `testing` network and attaching both the `postgres` container and the other containers (like the backend, web app, etc.) to this network, you're ensuring that each container can communicate using its container name (`postgres`) as the hostname. This means that, within Docker Compose, your web container can use `postgres:5432` as the address to connect to PostgreSQL (rather than `localhost`).

- **Separation of Steps:**
  - **Prisma Migrations (`bunx prisma migrate dev`)**: Running migrations before the Docker Compose step ensures your database schema is set up before the services attempt to use the database.
  - **Building Next.js (`bun run build`)**: You are building the app separately first, which is a good approach for production-ready images. This helps avoid having the build process inside the container when you don't need it. The `.next` build folder is created outside the container, and then you can copy it into the container during the build process. 

- **Why Docker Compose Is Essential:** 
  While you can build individual containers with `docker run`, Docker Compose provides a much cleaner way to handle multiple services (like your web app, backend, and database) that need to be built and run together. Without Docker Compose, you’d have to manually manage the networks and links between each service, and it would become more difficult to scale your app. Compose simplifies everything by handling networking, volume mounting, and the interdependencies between containers.


# But you know the problem this is not a correct way of doing these things, its a very bad implementation
